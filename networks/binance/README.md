# Binance Introduction

> BNB Chain, one of the most popular blockchains in the world, dedicates to delivering its core infrastructure necessary for future public adoption, and always remains as a community-first and open-source ecosystem built on a permissionless and decentralized environment.

> `Binance Chain` and `Binance Smart Chain` have formed together as BNB Chain since February 15, 2022. BNB Chain comprises `BNB Beacon Chain` (previously Binance Chain) and BNB Smart Chain (previously Binance Smart Chain). While `BNB` (formerly called “Binance Coin”) has also been renamed as `“Build and Build.”` 

## What is Build N Build (BNB) Chain?​

> BNB Chain is comprised of:

1. `BNB Beacon Chain` (previously Binance Chain) - BNB Chain Governance (Staking, Voting)

1. `BNB Smart Chain` (BSC) (previously Binance Smart Chain) - EVM compatible, consensus layers, and with hubs to multi-chains

1. `BNB Sidechain` - Ready-to-use PoS solutions for developing custom blockchains and dApps with existing BSC functionality.

1. `BNB ZkRolllup` (Coming soon) - ZkRollup solution to scale BSC as an super high performance blockchains.

## BNB Token

> BNB stands for “Build and Build”. Along with fueling transactions on BNB Chain (similar to gas on Ethereum), BNB also acts as a governance token. **Holding BNB** gives you the right to make your voice heard and is necessary for **participation in BNB Chain’s decentralized on-chain governance**. With this name change also comes more advancements to benefit users, projects and developers connected to the BNB Chain community.

## Key Features

> BSC 2021 (current version) introduces a considerable block size of 100m gas ceiling. We plan to introduce a more advanced logic for blockchain storage and BSC client to cover it and allow further expansion. 

> Currently, to fully sync the BSC blockchain, validators need extensive storage and time. Scaling down the validator and node operator requirements is necessary to enable a seamless BSC experience.

> New technologies, like Erigon, are being verified to decrease both time and storage demands for validators nodes while performing full sync.

> Working with validators and infrastructure providers to deploy new solutions to address this issue, such as

1. Parallel EVM
1. Better block process pipeline
1. Improved state caching
1. Fast sync mode
1. Distributed nodes
1. 20 more validators to join the block production of BSC 2022

## Future Goal​

> Innovation never sleeps, and it’s clear that the future of BNB Chain goes into a world of over 1 billion users. BNB Chain’s mission is to build the infrastructure that powers the world’s parallel virtual ecosystem, and BNB Chain’s commitment to the community is that it will be:

1. Open
1. Multi-chain
1. For creators and inventors
1. Permissionless
1. Forever decentralized

## Getting started

> The purpose of this tutorial is to give a general overview of BNB Chain and to serve as a starting point for new users to the BNB Chain ecosystem. General knowledge of cryptocurrency is assumed, and in particular familiarity with the Ethereum ecosystem. If you don't understand something right away, that's OK. Search for an answer online, and if you don't find it, ask on our Discord.

> We **recommend reading this document entirely before using BNB Chain so that you can avoid common pitfalls and problems that new users run into**. There are many multiple components of the BNB Chain, so it's best to get a full picture of things before diving in to save yourself confusion.

> You can find a general overview of BNB Chain here. It will be useful in understanding similarities and differences between BNB Chain and other platforms.

## BNB Chain: Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain​

> BNB Chain is composed of two blockchains - Beacon Chain (BC) and BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The `Beacon Chain` is the blockchain component that is responsible for `the governance of the BNB Chain` and manages staking and voting on the BNB Chain. Whereas, the `BNB Smart Chain` is the blokchain component that is `EVM compatible, consensus layers`, and with hubs to multi-chains.

- Beacon chain: the on-chain governance of Binance chain 
- BNB smart chain: EVM-compatible, consensus layer

## What can you do with Beacon Chain(BC)?​

> The purpose of the Beacon Chain is to provide an efficient blockchain ecosystem that works along a DEX to provide an alternative marketplace for issuing and exchanging digital assets in a decentralized manner.

> You can:

1. Send and receive BNB
1. Issue new tokens to digitalize assets, and use Beacon Chain as underlying exchange/transfer network for the assets
1. Send, receive, burn/mint and freeze/unfreeze tokens
1. Sumbit an on-chain governance proposal for BNB Smart Chain

> For traders, you can:

1. Propose to create trading pairs between two different tokens
1. Send orders to buy or sell assets through trading pairs created on the chain with SDK
1. Watch the DEX market to confirm price and market activity of certain assets
