# Learning OZ ERC165
## Motivation

> For some “standard interfaces” like the ERC-20 token interface, it is sometimes useful to query whether a contract supports the interface and if yes, which version of the interface, in order to adapt the way in which the contract is to be interacted with. Specifically for ERC-20, a version identifier has already been proposed. This proposal standardizes the concept of interfaces and standardizes the identification (naming) of interfaces.

## How a Contract will Publish the Interfaces it Implements

> A contract that is compliant with ERC-165 shall implement the following interface (referred as ERC165.sol):

> The interface identifier for this interface is 0x01ffc9a7. You can calculate this by running bytes4(keccak256('supportsInterface(bytes4)')); or using the Selector contract above.

> Therefore the implementing contract will have a supportsInterface function that returns:

1. true when interfaceID is 0x01ffc9a7 (EIP165 interface)
1. **true for any other interfaceID this contract implements**
1. false when interfaceID is 0xffffffff
1. false for any other interfaceID
