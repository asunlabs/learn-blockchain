# Learning blockchain on AWS essentials

> AWS has over 70+ validated blockchain solutions.

> AWS provides purpose-built tools to support your distinct needs, whether you need a centralized ledger database that maintains an immutable and cryptographically verifiable record of transactions, or a multi-party, fully managed blockchain network that helps eliminate intermediaries.

> More customers trust AWS for their blockchain and ledger technology workloads than any other cloud vendor. **25% of all Ethereum workloads in the world run on AWS**. Enterprise customers for Hyperledger Fabric include Nestle, Sony Music, BMW, Sage, Guardian, DTCC, Workday, Klarna Bank, SGX, Legal & General, Splunk, Zilliant, Contura Energy, DVLA UK, and many more.

> Developing blockchain and ledger applications is simpler, faster, and more efficient with AWS. Amazon Managed Blockchain eliminates the heavy lifting involved in the setup of blockchain networks by reducing 60% of time taken in hosting Hyperledger Fabric frameworks. Managed Blockchain also makes it easy to operate networks as it support AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation, and Amazon Cloudwatch logs. Amazon QLDB is 2 â€“ 3X faster than traditional frameworks and also provides SQL-like operators and a document data model for handling transactions.

## Amazon managed blockchain

> Choice of frameworks between Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.

> Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service that makes it easy to join public networks or create and manage scalable private networks using the popular open-source Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum frameworks. You can write smart contracts and applications and run them on the blockchain network to transact securely.

1. Choose an open source blockchain framework, and with a few clicks, join public networks or create a new private network
1. For private networks, invite other AWS accounts to join the network.
1. Select peer nodes that store a copy of the distributed ledger.
1. Create and deploy decentralized applications through your peer nodes. Transact with peers without a centralized authority.

### Benefits of using Amazon managed blockchain

> Get started with blockchain in minutes. With Amazon Managed Blockchain, you can quickly create blockchain networks that span multiple AWS accounts and eliminate manual provisioning of hardware and configuring of software, security, and network settings.

> Amazon Managed Blockchain leverages Amazon Quantum Ledger Database Technology (QLDB) to improve the reliability of the Hyperledger Fabric Ordering Service. Also, Managed Blockchain uses AWS Key Management Service (KMS) technology to secure the Hyperledger Fabric Certificate Authority.

> Send blockchain network activity from Amazon Managed Blockchain to AWS analytics services like Amazon Redshift to get additional insights from your network.

### Use cases

> Financial institutions can reduce the time and cost of cross-boundary asset transfers by using an Amazon Managed Blockchain network to directly send payments to other network members in a trusted way.

> Manufacturing businesses can use an Amazon Managed Blockchain network as a transparent and efficient way to keep track of ownership of goods that move across global supply chain networks.
