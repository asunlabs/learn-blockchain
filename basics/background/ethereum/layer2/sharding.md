# Sharding

> Sharding is a multi-phase upgrade to improve Ethereum’s scalability and capacity.

> Sharding provides secure distribution of data storage requirements, enabling rollups to be even cheaper, and making nodes easier to operate.

> They enable layer 2 solutions to offer low transaction fees while leveraging the security of Ethereum.

> This upgrade is planned to follow The Merge of Mainnet with the Beacon Chain.

## WHEN'S IT SHIPPING?

> Sharding should ship sometime in 2023, depending on how quickly work progresses after The Merge. These shards will give Ethereum more capacity to store and access data, but they won’t be used for executing code.

## What is sharding?

> Sharding is the process of splitting a database horizontally to spread the load – it’s a common concept in computer science. In an Ethereum context, sharding will work synergistically with layer 2 rollups by splitting up the burden of handling the large amount of data needed by rollups over the entire network. This will continue to reduce network congestion and increase transactions per second.

> This is important for reasons other than scalability.


## Features of sharding

**Everyone can run a node**

> Sharding is a good way to scale if you want to keep things decentralized as the alternative is to scale by increasing the size of the existing database. This would make Ethereum less accessible for network validators because they'd need powerful and expensive computers. With sharding, validators will no longer be required to store all of this data themselves, but instead can use data techniques to confirm that the data has been made available by the network as a whole. This drastically reduces the cost of storing data on layer 1 by reducing hardware requirements.

**More network participation**

> Sharding will eventually let you run Ethereum on a personal laptop or phone. So more people should be able to participate, or run clients, in a sharded Ethereum. This will increase security because the more decentralized the network, the smaller the attack surface area.

> With lower hardware requirements, sharding will make it easier to run clients on your own, without relying on any intermediary services at all. And if you can, consider running multiple clients. This can help network health by further reducing points of failure. Run a Beacon Chain client

> At first, you'll need to run a Mainnet (execution layer) client at the same time as your Beacon Chain (consensus later) client. The launchpad will walk you through the hardware requirements and process.
