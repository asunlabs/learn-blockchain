# ZERO-KNOWLEDGE ROLLUPS

> Zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups) are layer 2 scaling solutions that increase throughput on Ethereum Mainnet by moving computation and state-storage off-chain. _ZK-rollups can process thousands of transactions in a batch and then only post some minimal summary data to Mainnet_. This summary data defines the changes that should be made to the Ethereum state and some cryptographic proof that those changes are correct.

> PREREQUISITES: You should have read and understood our page on Ethereum scaling and layer 2.
