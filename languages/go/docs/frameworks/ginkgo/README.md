# Learning Ginkgo essentials

> **Ginkgo** is a testing framework for Go designed to help you write expressive tests. It is best paired with the **Gomega** matcher library. When combined, Ginkgo and Gomega provide a rich and expressive DSL (Domain-specific Language) for writing tests.

> Ginkgo is sometimes described as a "Behavior Driven Development" (BDD) framework. In reality, Ginkgo is a general purpose testing framework in active use across a wide variety of testing contexts: unit tests, integration tests, acceptance test, performance tests, etc.

> The narrative docs you are reading here are supplemented by the godoc API-level docs. We suggest starting here to build a mental model for how Ginkgo works and understand how the Ginkgo DSL can be used to solve real-world testing scenarios. These docs are written assuming you are familiar with Go and the Go toolchain and that you are using Ginkgo V2 (V1 is no longer supported - see here for the migration guide).
